Integrating enriched, longitudinal multi-level data for local population musculoskeletal health intelligence: North Staffordshire &amp; Stoke-on-Trentâ€¯ 

## Background and context 

The overall aim of the MIDAS research project is to develop and implement a place-based system of musculoskeletal health intelligence in the population of North Staffordshire & Stoke-on-Trent that provides useful, timely, sustainable, trustworthy evidence for policymakers, practitioners, and the public. Our focus is on common non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain conditions in the adult population. 

Our project targets the critical gap in the capture of patient-reported information on risk factors, health states, outcomes, and experiences of care and linkage to high-quality primary care electronic health record (EHR) data, other key data from the health and care system, and to the wider determinants of health.
