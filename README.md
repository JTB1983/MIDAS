# MIDAS
Integrating enriched, longitudinal multi-level data for local population musculoskeletal health intelligence: North Staffordshire &amp; Stoke-on-Trent  

## Background and context 

The overall aim of the MIDAS research project is to develop and implement a place-based system of musculoskeletal health intelligence in the population of North Staffordshire & Stoke-on-Trent that provides useful, timely, sustainable, trustworthy evidence for policymakers, practitioners, and the public. Our focus is on common non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain conditions in the adult population. 

Our project targets the critical gap in the capture of patient-reported information on risk factors, health states, outcomes, and experiences of care and linkage to high-quality primary care electronic health record (EHR) data, other key data from the health and care system, and to the wider determinants of health. 

## Project summary:

Reducing the burden of common musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions and addressing NHS priorities requires better integration of data upstream of hospital care. Meaningful data collected from population level surveys, primary care electronic health records (EHR) and MSK community service providers have not been co-ordinated and linked together to inform public health and primary care policy making. In this project, we seek to overcome these barriers by developing a novel and scalable approach within North Staffordshire & Stoke-on-Trent (population ≈ 483,000).

The SNOMED CT code list created to identify potential patients contains 498 SNOMED Concept IDs which cover codes identified in the CPRD AURUM database with a prevalance of 0.5/10,000 or more between 2014 and 2019.
